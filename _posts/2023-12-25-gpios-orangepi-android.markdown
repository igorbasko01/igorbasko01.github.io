## Overview
FIXME: Write overview of the whole post. Which final project I'm working on, including Unity.

## OrangePi Background
FIXME: Give some background about the OrangePi SBC that was used. And which OS is used in the OrangePi SBC. Why I chose this SBC and OS.

## OrangePi Android OS
FIXME: Give some background about the OrangePi Android OS, where it could be found, and how to download and unpack it.

## WiringOP
FIXME: Give some background about the WiringOP application and the way to build it, and what it produces.

## WiringOP Internals
FIXME: Give background about the relevant internals of WiringOP, which files are necesseray to copy to our own project, and why it is important to keep the package name `com.example.wiringop` the same in our project as well, and why we need to run the `chmod 666 /dev/mem`.

## Our Project
FIXME: Give a background on which type of project we are creating in Android Studio, why it is an Android library (so it would be possible to use it in Unity), and how the copied files are used in our library.

## Unity
FIXME: describe how this library will be used in Unity. How it should be built, and what do we need to do in Unity player settings to use arm64-v8a.

## Conclusion
FIXME: Summarize the steps that were done.
